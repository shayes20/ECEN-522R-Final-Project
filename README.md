# ECEN 522R Final Project

## HIDden Data Part 1 - Dell Keyboard

The flash drive sat in an evidence bag, its crocodile sticker a mocking reminder of the audacious heist. The crew that hit Gold Standard National wasn’t just bold—they were precise. No fingerprints, no alarms, just the sound of vault doors swinging open and $25 million vanishing overnight.  

But they made one mistake. They left *this*.  

A seemingly harmless flash drive, recovered near the getaway site, now sat under the glare of the forensics lab lights. Inside was a single, cryptic file. Our analysts were stumped—whatever’s on it is encoded, concealed, or worse. *"It’s a message,"* one said. *"Or a key."*

Your mission is clear: **decipher the data and find what was HIDden. The crew left breadcrumbs—now it's your turn to follow them.**

Let’s take down the Crocodile Crew.

## HIDden Data Part 2 - Mac Keyboard

The Crocodile Crew was meticulous, leaving almost nothing behind. But almost wasn’t enough. Hidden in the chaos of their abandoned safehouse, wedged between coffee-stained blueprints and a half-empty duffle bag, was a Mac computer.  

What did they program into it? Keyloggers? Backdoors? A payload designed to take over the bank’s secure systems? One thing is clear: **This computer was more than a tool—it was a weapon.**

## HIDden Data Part 3 - Razer Keyboard

The Crocodile Crew always had a flair for style, and their latest calling card didn’t disappoint. Left behind at the scene of their latest heist was a gaming keyboard, glowing in vivid chromatic waves as if mocking the investigators.  

How did they do it? Custom macros? Firmware exploits? Or something more sinister?  

Your mission: **deconstruct the keyboard and uncover the Crocodile Crew’s secret**

## Mouse Hunt Part 1 - Dell Mouse

The heist was flawless—almost too flawless. Security footage showed nothing but an empty vault and a short blip in the system logs. Whatever tool the Crocodile Crew used, it bypassed every safeguard, every trap. Buried under a pile of discarded equipment in a nearby alley was an input device. 

Now it’s in your hands. Your mission: **reverse-engineer the Crocodile Crew’s tool**

## Mouse Hunt Part 2 - Razer Mouse

When the Crocodile Crew struck, they left behind a digital trail so faint it was almost a ghost. But at the scene of their latest heist, investigators found something curious: a mouse, its neon glow pulsing rhythmically in the darkness.  

What was it hiding? Custom scripts? A payload to breach air-gapped systems? A trigger for something bigger?  

Your mission: **reverse-engineer the mouse and uncover how the Crocodile Crew weaponized it.**
